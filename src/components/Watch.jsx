        <h2 id="Title">Praise in Advance: 23 Years of Worship</h2>

        <p id="history">
            Praise in Advance began 23 years ago as a powerful moment for worshippers around the world to gather in praises to God. Rooted in <strong>John 4:24</strong>, which emphasizes worshiping in spirit and truth, this annual concert originated from <strong>Tower of Victory Church International</strong>.
        </p>

        <p id="history">
            For the first 18 years, it was simply known as a praise night, a time dedicated to worship. However, for the past five years, the event has officially been tagged "Praise in Advance." This evolution signifies a deeper commitment to praise and has attracted renowned ministers of God and various churches, uniting them in worship and song.
        </p>

        <p id="history">
            Each year, Praise in Advance has been a tremendous blessing, witnessing miraculous testimonies from attendees who experience Godâ€™s power at work in their lives through the program. The event is not only a concert; it also features exciting games, including a dance competition where the best dancer wins a prize, along with giveaways like recharge cards.
        </p>

        <p id="history">
            This year marks the 23rd season of Praise in Advance, set to take place in <strong>Ikorodu at the Tower of Victory Church International, Erunwen</strong>, on the <strong>15th of November 2024</strong> starting at <strong>7 PM</strong>. It promises to be the biggest concert in Ikorodu, delivering an unforgettable experience as worshippers come together to invoke the presence of the Most High God. As the saying goes, "When praises go up, blessings come down."
